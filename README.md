# Phase-1-Static-Blog
Example Static Blog for assignment

This blog has the following pages: Home, About, Blog, and Contact. 

I demo several features utilizing bootstrap such as carousel. 

I also make use of javascript to validate the contact form.

The navigation bar will take you to the different pages and it will highlight the page you are currently viewing in the top right.

The navigation bar also sticks to the top of the page if you scroll down.
